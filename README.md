# quick-be-client

Quick BE is a super basic, out-of-the-box Node.JS backend wrapper for Google Datastore (though it could
probably be modified for any cloud NoSQL service without much trouble).

It includes basic user registration/authentication with JSON Web Tokens.

This is the front-end client. The accompanying back-end module is available at:

```
npm install quick-be
```

I mostly use this for my own purposes but am happy to help with community requests.
